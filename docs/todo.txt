To do:

- Add debug and release builds to Cmake with different compiler options.
- Continue the rewrite of instruction handling
- Handle display updates to memory
- Make a README
- Transform bits in memory to texture
- Draw square with OpenGL
- Write tests for the instruction set.
- Re-implement logging
- Remove boost.program_options. It is a very bloated library but it does the job fine.
- Implement keyboard input
- Implement controller input (xbox 360)
- Research audio (Low priority)
