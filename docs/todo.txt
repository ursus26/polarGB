To do:

- Add debug and release builds to Cmake with different compiler options.
- Continue the rewrite of instruction handling (high priority)
- Handle display updates to memory
- Make a README
- Transform bits in memory to texture
- Draw square with OpenGL
- Write tests for the instruction set.
- Re-implement logging
- Use a standardized printing library. Currently the project uses printf and iostream. Printf is
  great but it is C and not C++ however the usability is fantastic. Iostream is the c++ way but it
  is horrible to use and you have to type a lot of characters. Maybe look at the library "fmt".
- Remove boost.program_options. It is a very bloated library but it does the job fine.
- Implement keyboard input
- Implement controller input (xbox 360)
- Research audio (Low priority)
